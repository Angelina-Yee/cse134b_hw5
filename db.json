            "description": "A web application that is currently in progress. The attached audio is one of the many type of sounds and music I listen to when I study. Hence, the idea is to create a website to play soft and melodic sounds according to a specific location that the user might want. For example, a user might be working in their dorm room, but finds it hard to focus since they usually study at a cafe and thinks that they would focus more there. By using this website, users can imagine as if they are in a cafe and have sounds like baristas or coffee brewing added to the default melodic music."

In the scene, the characters can be seen playing a rather violent game of Rock-Paper-Scissor-MinusONE. This is a popular game in korea that my friends and I have started to play to increase the intensity of regular rock paper scissor. Therefore, my friend and I have decided to make it into a game that others can play with their friends as well!",
